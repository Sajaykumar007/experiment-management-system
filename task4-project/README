## Task 4: Experiment Evaluation & Metrics

Implemented execution time tracking and output evaluation to analyze experiment performance.

Why this matters:

Moves beyond “running code” to measuring outcomes

Introduces basic performance metrics and scoring

Reflects experimentation and monitoring mindset used in real systems

Task 4: Experiment Evaluation & Metrics
## Overview

Task 4 focuses on evaluating experiment execution results by measuring performance metrics and output quality.
This task demonstrates how experiment outcomes can be analyzed, scored, and reported in a structured way.

## Tech Stack

Python

FastAPI

REST APIs

Swagger UI

## Objective

Measure execution time of an experiment

Evaluate output quality

Assign a score and status to the experiment

Return structured evaluation results via API

🚀 How to Run
# Navigate to Task 4 project
cd task4-project

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Start the server

🔗 API Implemented

POST /run-task4 – Executes experiment logic, measures performance, and evaluates results

🧪 Sample Request
{
  "input_text": "Task 4 execution and evaluation test"
}

📤 Sample Response
{
  "status": "completed",
  "output": "TASK 4 EXECUTION AND EVALUATION TEST",
  "execution_time_sec": 0.01,
  "evaluation": {
    "score": 8,
    "quality": "Good"
  }
}

## Evaluation Logic

Execution Time: Calculated in seconds for each request

Output Quality:

No output → Failed (score: 0)

Short output → Average (score: 4)

Meaningful output → Good (score: 8)

## Task 4 Outcome

Execution time successfully measured

Output evaluated using defined rules

Score and quality assigned

Structured API response returned
