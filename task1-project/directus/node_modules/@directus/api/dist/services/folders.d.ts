     * Builds a full folder tree starting from a given root folder.
     *
     * This method returns a map of folder IDs to their corresponding paths
     * relative to the root. It resolves all nested child folders and ensures
     * that folder names are deduplicated within the same parent.
     *
     * Access control is applied automatically when non-admin, only folders the user has `read`
     * access to are included.
     *
     * @param {string} root - The ID of the root folder to start building the tree from.
     * @returns {Promise<Map<string, string>>} A `Map` where:
     *   - Key: folder ID
     *   - Value: folder path relative to the root (e.g., "Documents/Photos")
     *
     * @example
     * const foldersService = new FoldersService({ schema, accountability });
     * const tree = await foldersService.buildTree('root-folder-id');
     * console.log(tree.get('folder1')); // e.g., "RootFolder/SubFolder1"
     *
     * @remarks
     * - The returned `Map` includes the root folder itself.
     * - If a folder has no name, its ID will be used as a fallback.
